# Solar Opposites Episode Checker
Cool little app that lets you select a season and episode of Solar Opposites and it will use an API to fetch details about that episode.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (fetch api)

Uses html, css and javascript. Javascript - fetch api, we extra the episode image and plot and insert it into the DOM. CSS is styled to look similar to the Justin Roiland aesthetic

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

The CSS isn't perfect but the overall design achieved was something I was happy with. It is fairly flexible. 
## Lessons Learned:

A few things with CSS and fetch. I am learning flexbox atm so this was using mostly flex. Also a hidden click event!

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
